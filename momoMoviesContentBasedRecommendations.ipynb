    "# Content Based Movie Recommendation System\n",
    "This application uses a dataset called TheMoviesDatasets, which contains tens of thousands of different movies. From this large dataset, we used about 5,000 of the movies. Each of these movies hold additional information such as the genre, revenue, budget, release date, etc. The goal for this project is to give the user a recommendation of movies based of genres and keywords. \n",

    "Recommendation systems have become very popular in recent times, and not only have they been used for movies, but also for music, shopping items, etc. Many companies such as Spotify, Netflix, and Amazon have utilized this tool to give a better experience for the user. \n",

    "# Content-Based Recommendation Model\n",
    "This model is a Content Based Recommendation model that is seperated into 2 categories: genre and keywords. The model uses the concepts of Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) to determine the relative importance of the genre or keyword. After calculating the TF-IDF values, in order to see how similar items are to each other, we used vector space modeling. Each item is stored as a vector, and the similarity can be correlated with the proximity between any two vectors. The proximity is found by taking the angle between the vectors. Then, using the TF-IDF scores and the vector space model, we can create a dot product that gives the value of the cosine similarity score. This score is a number than can be directly used to find the similarity between two movies. Through all that math and logic we successfully created a content based recommendation model that returns 10 similar movies based off a given movie the user chooses. Depending on what content based recommendation system the user picks, the 10 movies can be similar based off genre, or the keywords of the chosen movie.\n",
